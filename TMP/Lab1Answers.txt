Q1 - What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and 
disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Ans1 - 	

Advantages -

1.Exponential Distribution:
We have to just control the random number generator and because of randomization all the processes have equal chance 
of getting scheduled. The problem of starvation is also resolved

2.Linux Like:
For a given time frame all the processes are scheduled according to their priority and goodness value which ensures 
fairness.

3.Round Robin Scheduler:
It's a lot faster. We just have to compare the priorities. All the processes get equal running time. It has a better response
time as well.

Disadvantages -

1.Exponential Distribution:
There may be a starvation for I/O processes. If the value of lambda is not chosen properly it may cause unfair scheduling.

2.Linux Like:
Response time is very less as lot of calculations are involved.

3.Round Robin Scheduler:
The problem of starvation is highly likely.

Q2 - Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Ans2 - 
1.Exponential Distribution: NULL processes are scheduled when the ready queue is empty.
2.Linux Like Scheduler: NULL processes are not scheduled.
3.Default: NULL processes are not scheduled.
